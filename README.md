# Facebook Mobile Slide Menu in HTML5 + CSS3

The goals of this small project are:

- Minimal javascript
- Rely on CSS for animations
- Behave as much like the iOS implementation as possible
- Fixed search header in menu
- Do not scroll main content area when menu is visible
- Use new iOS overflow: scroll / -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch if possible (buggy)

## Notes

The HTML and CSS are a work in progress and in no way production read. My initial goal was simply to get the page to resemble the current Facebook web site.

I have inline most of the images using data-uri's so that I could work on this offline. All images/icons used here belong to Facebook and I am simply using them to educational purposes.

## Preview in iOS device

Simply clone/fork this project and load it up in iOS simulator or on your ipod/iphone device if you can figure out how to host it locally on Apache or something. I'm working on putting together a demo page or screencast to show this off. Stay tuned!
